    <h3><b>Why all of this exist?</b></h3>
    <h4><b>#stayathome</b> – It’s time to catch up on games, trying something new, creating a new character or just wandering around the maps.<br><br>
        Our Guild decided to make this difficult period more pleasant for all Players by creating events even for Those who have just 
        started Their adventure in GW2.<br><br>
        The initiative was created during a pandemic but it will not end with it. We will continue to organize our 
        events until You participate.<br>
        We will try to organize even more, if possible.<br><br>
        No matter where we come from <br>or what we believe in. <b>We’re all Humans.</b></h4>
